Transistor is a radio app with a minimalistic approach, that may not be to everyone's liking. It has no radio station discovery feature. Transistor only offers a very simple search option and it imports audio streaming links, when you tap on them in a web browser.


FREQUENT QUESTIONS

HOW CAN I ADD A RADIO STATION
There are three ways to add a radio station to Transistor: Use Search, add playlist file address (M3U, PLS), enter a raw stream address. The last way will not support the update feature.

HOW DOES THE UPDATE FEATURE WORK?
The update feature will try to fetch the current stream address of a station as well as the updated name and station image. The feature will not work for stations added via a raw stream address, or for stations imported from Transistor v3.

WHERE DO THE RADIO STATION SEARCH RESULTS COME FROM?
Transistor searches the radio-browser.info online database. You can help out the radio-browser.info community by adding the missing station (http://www.radio-browser.info/gui/#!/add) to their database.

WHICH AUDIO FORMATS ARE SUPPORTED?
Transistor can play back streams encoded in MP3, AAC and Ogg/Opus. It also has experimental support for HLS streams.
